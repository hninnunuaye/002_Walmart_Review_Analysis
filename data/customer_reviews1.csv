The 3 stars because it's a Stanley and I love the color and size. 

Minus 1 star for the terrible smudging and water drip marks that make it look dirty even starting off in the morning... embarrassing if at a conference. 

Minus a 2nd star for the finish coming off the bottom. As you can see, it's barely (and gently) used -- the sticker is still intact. 

I loved my other Stanley and am kicking myself for giving it away and spending so much on this style. I'm not sure who tested it before production, but it seems like someone didn't think everything through.

This level of wear and tear feels unacceptable for a Stanley product, especially compared to my other mugs that have held up flawlessly for years.
